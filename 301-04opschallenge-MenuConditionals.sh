# Purpose:                      To create a bash script that launches a menu system with the following options:
#                                  * Hello world (prints “Hello world!” to the screen)
#                                  * Ping self (pings this computer’s loopback address)
#                                  * IP info (print the network adapter information for this computer)
#                                  * Exit
#                               Next, the user input should be requested.
#                               The program should next use a conditional statement to evaluate the user’s input, 
#                               then act according to what the user selected.
#                               Use a loop to bring up the menu again after the request has been executed.
