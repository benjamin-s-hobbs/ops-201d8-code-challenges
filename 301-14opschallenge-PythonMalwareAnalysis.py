## Analysis Name:                        Ops Challenge: 301Class14opschallenge-PythonMalwareAnalysis.py
## Analysis Author:                      Ben Hobbs
## Date of Analysis latest revision:     06/16/2023
## Purpose:                              Perform an analysis of the Python-based code.
##                                       Insert comments into each line of the script explaining in your own words what the virus is doing on this line.
##                                       Insert comments above each function explaining what the purpose of this function is and what it hopes to carry out.
##                                       Insert comments above the final three lines explaining how the functions are called and what this script appears to do.
