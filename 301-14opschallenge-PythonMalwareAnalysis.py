## Analysis Author:                      Ben Hobbs
## Date of Analysis latest revision:     06/16/2023
## Purpose:                              Perform an analysis of the Python-based code.
##                                       Insert comments into each line of the script explaining in your own words what the virus is doing on this line.
##                                       Insert comments above each function explaining what the purpose of this function is and what it hopes to carry out.
##                                       Insert comments above the final three lines explaining how the functions are called and what this script appears to do.

#!/usr/bin/python3
## These are the two libraries that the attacker references in his python script to write this code. This is our second indicator that this script
## is written in python3. "os" is a library named "Miscellaneous operating system (os) interfaces" that provides a portable way of using operating 
## system dependent functionality. We can see here that "os" is imported here.
