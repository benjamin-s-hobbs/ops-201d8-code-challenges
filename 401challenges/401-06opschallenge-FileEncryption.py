# Purpose:                      In Python, create a script that utilizes the cryptography library to:
#                               Prompt the user to select a mode:
#                               Encrypt a file      (mode 1)
#                               Decrypt a file      (mode 2)
#                               Encrypt a message   (mode 3)
#                               Decrypt a message   (mode 4)
#                               If mode 1 or 2 are selected, prompt the user to provide a filepath to a target file.
#                               If mode 3 or 4 are selected, prompt the user to provide a cleartext string.
#                               Depending on the selection, perform one of the below functions. 
#
#                               Youâ€™ll need to create four functions:
#                               Encrypt the target file if in mode 1.
#                               Delete the existing target file and replace it entirely with the encrypted version.
#                               Decrypt the target file if in mode 2.
#                               Delete the encrypted target file and replace it entirely with the decrypted version.
#                               Encrypt the string if in mode 3.
#                               Print the ciphertext to the screen.
#                               Decrypt the string if in mode 4.
#                               Print the cleartext to the screen.
