# Purpose:                      In Python, create a TCP Port Range Scanner that tests whether a TCP port is open or closed. The script must:
#                               Utilize the scapy library
#                               Define host IP
#                               Define port range or specific set of ports to scan
#                               Test each port in the specified range using a for loop
#                               If flag 0x12 received, send a RST packet to graciously close the open connection. 
#Notify the user the port is open.
#                               If flag 0x14 received, notify user the port is closed.
#                               If no flag is received, notify the user the port is filtered and silently dropped.
