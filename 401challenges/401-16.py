# Purpose:                      In Python, create a script that prompts the user to select one of the following modes:
#                               Mode 1: Offensive; Dictionary Iterator
#                               Accepts a user input word list file path and iterates through the word list, 
#                               assigning the word being read to a variable.
#                               Add a delay between words.
#                               Print to the screen the value of the variable.
#                               Mode 2: Defensive; Password Recognized
#                               Accepts a user input string.
#                               Accepts a user input word list file path.
#                               Search the word list for the user input string.
#                               Print to the screen whether the string appeared in the word list.
