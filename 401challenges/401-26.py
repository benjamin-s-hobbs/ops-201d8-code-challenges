# Purpose:                      First, visit Python Logging Tutorial and practice the Basic Logging Tutorial.
#                               Next, review terminology at What Are stdin, stdout, and stderr on Linux? 
#                               before visiting Logging Module in Python for some examples to get you started.
#                               By now, you will have created several Python scripts in your public repo. 
#                               Select one of your Python tools created during this class so far that does not have a logging feature. 
#                               On that tool:
#                               Add logging capabilities to your Python tool using the logging library.
#                               Experiment with log types. Build in some error handling, then induce some errors. 
#                               Send log data to a file in the local directory.
#                               Confirm your logging feature is working as expected.
