# Author:                       Ben Hobbs
# Date of latest revision:      08/15/2023
# Purpose:                      On the Python tool you added logging capabilities to:

#                               Add a log rotation feature based on size
#                               Stretch Goals (Optional Objectives)
#                               Copy the Python tool and remove the log rotation by size feature. 
#                               Instead:

#                               Add a log rotation feature based on time
#                               Submit both versions of your script.
