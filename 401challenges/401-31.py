# Purpose:                      Ops Challenge: Signature-based Malware Detection Part 1 of 3
#                               In Python, write a script that will:
#                               
#                               Prompt the user to type in a file name to search for.
#                               Prompt the user for a directory to search in.
#                               Search each file in the directory by name.
#                               
#                               TIP: You may need to perform different commands depending on what OS youâ€™re executing the script on.
#                               
#                               For each positive detection, print to the screen the file name and location.
#                               At the end of the search process, print to the screen how many files were searched and how many hits were found.
#                               The script must successfully execute on both Ubuntu Linux 20.04 Focal Fossa and Windows 10.
