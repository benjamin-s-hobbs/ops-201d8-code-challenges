# Purpose:                      Ops Challenge: Web Application Fingerprinting
#                               For this lab youâ€™ll need to develop and test your Python script from a Linux VM with the tools Nmap, Netcat, and Telnet installed. Generally speaking, Kali Linux is the recommendation for this challenge.
#                               In Python create a script that executes from a Linux box to perform the following:
#                               Prompts the user to type a URL or IP address.
#                               Prompts the user to type a port number.
#                               Performs banner grabbing using netcat against the target address at the target port; prints the results to the screen then moves on to the step below.
#                               Performs banner grabbing using telnet against the target address at the target port; prints the results to the screen then moves on to the step below.
#                               Performs banner grabbing using Nmap against the target address of all well-known ports; prints the results to the screen.
