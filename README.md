README.md

## What is this repo all about? 

This repository is all about my first foray into the world of scripting, gitn' down with ACP, and first touches with languages and coding. Here is where I pushed my commits that I added that were assigned to familiarize me with working with GitHub, VS Code, Connecting to a host via SSH, virtual machines, and many other things as I jumped into the world of scripts, code, and Markdown (oh my). I've renamed this repo to ops-challenges (from ops-201d8-code-challenges) as a commitment to myself to complete courses 201/301/and401 to complete my training. This repo will showcase all of that progress, as I continue to learn, hone, and refine my expanding skillset.

## Why are you learning these skills?

To learn how to be a Cybersecurity Engineer. Full Stop. From there, I'll have the skills to move however I'm needed in this field. Ideally, my plan is to start out as an analyst in a SOC, honing and sharpening my Blue Team knowledge, because the world needs a lot of that at the moment. As I do that, I'll train in Red Team methodologies to better understand what it is like to attack targets from the outside. This will enhance my Blue Team knowledge and inspire me to create some tools that I can better defend with. Then having perfected my Form III, Form II, and Form VII I'll become Purple, which is my goal. #IYKYK

## What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?

This one, because I reflect on what I have learned in this course and why I am here in the first place. 
Orrrrr, The infinite loop one where we killed a process, mostly because I referenced 1980's movie WarGames


## How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?

They can automate tasks to accomplish a lot of work in a shorter amount of time. They can make our job easier (by knowing more about how to do our job)


## What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?

All. Of. Them. 
Seriously, I intend to do just that. I'm going to go back and improve them all

## What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?

I hope to improve my Creativity in creating functions and using variables. I will improve my documentation of what the script does in the script. I will also become more comfortable in using the keyboard shortcuts that make the editing so smooth and easy to do. I will continue to build good habits that I'll carry with me into my career.
