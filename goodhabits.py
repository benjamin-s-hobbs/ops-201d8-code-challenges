# Purpose:                      In Python, create an uptime sensor tool that uses ICMP packets to evaluate if 
#                               hosts on the LAN are up or down.
#                               The script must:
#                               Transmit a single ICMP (ping) packet to a specific IP every two seconds.
#                               Evaluate the response as either success or failure.
#                               Assign success or failure to a status variable.
#                               For every ICMP transmission attempted, print the status variable along with a 
#                               comprehensive timestamp and destination IP tested.
#                               Example output: 2020-10-05 17:57:57.510261 Network Active to 8.8.8.8
